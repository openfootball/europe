## What's `football.db`?

A free open public domain football (soccer) database & schema

## Build Your Own `europe.db` Copy

### Alternative I - Do-It-Yourself (DIY) - Download and Unpack Zip Archive or Git Clone

Download and unpack the zip archive with the datasets or if you have git installed use the `git clone` command to
get a local copy.

Try in your working folder (that is, `/europe`):

```
$ sportdb build
$ sportdb --verbose build     # or for more (verbose) details incl. debug info
```

This will

- setup a new single-file SQLite database e.g. `./sport.db`
- read in all datasets in plain text (`.txt`)

That's it.


### Alternative II  - Read / Load Match files with `football-to-sqlite` / `football-to-psql`

Run the `football-to-sqlite` tool against match files in the Football.TXT format like so:

```
$ football-to-sqlite belgium.db belgium/2020-21/1-firstdivisiona-i.txt
```

or pass in more than one match file:

```
$ football-to-sqlite switzerland.db switzerland/2020-21/1-superleague.txt \
                                    switzerland/2020-21/2-challengeleague.txt \
                                    switzerland/2019-20/1-superleague.txt \
                                    switzerland/2019-20/2-challengeleague.txt
```

Note: If the single-file SQLite database (and its tables, views & indices) do not (yet) exist,
they get auto-created on the first run.
